YOLOv8 is the latest "You Only Look Once" series object detection algorithm, designed to 
bring real-time object detection tasks with much improvement in speed and accuracy. Its 
architecture designs derive from its predecessors but are further improved by more 
sophisticated training methodologies, so it excels in various applications such as vehicle 
detection and counting. It can also be applied in traffic monitoring systems due to the high 
processing speed that it possesses in images and videos of high precision. With improved 
feature extraction and location capabilities, YOLOv8 assures overlaid detection and 
classification of objects, thus helping intelligent transport solutions more effectively and 
reliably.  
Object detection is such an important technology in computer vision that it will let one identify 
and locate objects within images or videos. This works through the adoption of the newest 
algorithms, such as YOLOv8, utilizing convolutional neural networks for visual data analysis 
in predicting object boundaries and classifications. Among the many advantages of object 
detection, outstanding ones include enhanced levels of automation, improved safety for 
autonomous vehicles, and efficient surveillance systems. The impact is huge on the world 
because it provides better cities, manages traffic, and ensures security. Object detection is 
therefore quite instrumental in driving innovations in many industries and daily life 
applications due to its accurate detection and tracking ability of objects in real-time.  
In this work, we have implemented object detection using the YOLOv8 engine to develop a 
model specifically designed for vehicle counting, zeroing in on cars. This model uses the 
advanced capabilities of YOLOv8 to process a sample video, undertaking vehicle detection in 
different lanes and following their trajectory. The goal of the research is to enhance the 
monitoring and management of traffic flow by providing vehicle count and classification highly 
accurately in real time. It provides our model with accurate data for traffic analysis, which is 
tuned on YOLOv8 to detect vehicles for better traffic flow and safety. This approach enunciates 
the potential of YOLOv8 in intelligent transportation systems and smart city applications.  
Using Python, we developed our methodology by analyzing a selected sample video sourced 
from the internet. Our approach involved placing two virtual lines across the video frame to 
facilitate lane-based vehicle counting. Vehicles crossing from the first line to the second were 
categorized as moving in one lane, while those crossing in the opposite direction were 
categorized for the other lane. This method enabled us to accurately count and differentiate 
vehicles based on their movement directions within the video perspective. Such precise lane 
detection forms a crucial aspect of our model's functionality in real-world traffic scenarios.  
Compared to others in the domain, our method is radically different and improved, as it uses 
YOLOv8 for the robust detection of vehicles and harnesses the power of Python in counting 
vehicle lanes with correct speed measurement in the video. The state-of-the-art tracking 
techniques give not only a vehicle counting feature to our model but also calculate the speed 
and show this information about speed on the terminal in real-time. This makes our model 
useful for more practical applications in traffic management, especially intelligent 
transportation systems.
